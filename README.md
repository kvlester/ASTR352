# Python activities for ASTR 352

In-class python notebooks created for my Spring 2024 Astrophysics III (Galaxies & the Universe) class at Mount Holyoke College. Students ran these notebooks in Google Colab. Each folder has the jupyter notebook and necessary data set(s) for each activity.

Activity 1 - Finding the shape and size of the Milky Way using positions of open and globular clusters

Activity 2 - Measure the redshifts and distances to galaxies to create your own Hubble's Law  (using a [UW's astronomy lab](https://depts.washington.edu/astroed/HubbleLaw/))

Activity 3 - Investigate the brightness profile and rotion curve of Andromeda to calculate the mass in stars vs. dark matter

Activity 4 - Use photometry and spectrum to calculate the mass of a supermassive black hole with reverberation mapping


You're welcome to email me if you would like the solutions to the activities, or if you have any suggestions / comments on the activities!
